My name is Nikita, I'm a 20yo student in MISIS. 
I've got fascinated about statistics about a year ago when Statistics course started in our uni and always solved algorithmical problems easily.
I knew not very much about programming and started to learn Python, because it was easy to read and learn and its flexbility.
For personal training, I solve 2-3 problems (at least try to) from codewars (now on kyu 4-5). Study mainly on Coursera w/o certificates (can't afford)
and Youtube (luckily there's a ton to learn on Youtube).

My ultimate goal is to become AI engineer. Besides stats, neuroscience is one of the biggest passions of mine. I'm an avid listener of Andrew Huberman, 
Lex Fridman and other podcasts about AI and neurophysiology.

#My goals
- get decent proficiency in Python and libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
- get familiar with SQLs (esp. PostgreSQL)
- learn data visualization tools and techniques (plan to learn PowerBI)
- and finally get a job in big IT company from Russia or somewhere else
- get experience and knowledge in the field of AI
